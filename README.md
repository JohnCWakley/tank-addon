# TankAddon
An addon for World of Warcraft that taunts target of high threat party/raid members.

## Description:
This addon creates a Units Frame of your party/raid members and visually shows their threat percentage in a red gradient growing upwards. If you're a tank, clicking on the party/raid member's unit frame will taunt their target. If you're a healer or DPS, clicking on a party/raid member will target their target (/assist).

This addon was inspired by Verro of <UNDAUNTED> on Fenris and his love of the original TauntMaster addon from back in the day.

And a very special thanks to my fellow guildies of <UNDAUNTED> on Fenris who helped in testing:

Devoile, Verro, Fezzie, Omgdots, Kayou, and others
